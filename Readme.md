Installation / Usage
--------------------
The app project in this repository was generated by Android Studio.
Use the 'import project' function in Android Studio to import the repository
as new project.

The WearGuitarTuner.apk file is also in this repository so that it can be used without 
building it yourself. But it won't be synched to the latest code base all the time.
Install the apk file on the handheld device and it will be synced to the
wearable device automatically (by the Android system).
